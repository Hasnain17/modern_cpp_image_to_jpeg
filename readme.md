# Modern C++17 (and some C++14) features in practise

This project shows off a few of the new core language additions as well as std enhancements
and is a tool to auto-convert all recognised image files in a given directory or on a web-page to jpg files.

Implemented are a C++17 version of the toojpeg library (~600 LOC), an http 'socket' (~600 LOC), a webpage-crawler (~100 LOC).

Used external libraries and header-only libraries: openSSL for https and `stb_image.h` for loading images.

A benchmark binary downloads and loads a 2d-projected picture of the earth
(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Eckert4.jpg, 1.6MB, Creative Commons License)
and writes it with the original and re-implemented toojpeg library. Find benchmark results at the end of this document.  

## Documentation

The code is Doxygen-compatible documented. Build the documentation via `cmake` and `make doc`.
A prebuild documentation is checked-in at `doc/html`.

## Tests

Tests are stored in the `tests/` directory. Build them with `cmake` and `make tests`.
A small C++17 featured test harness has been written in tests/tests.h to avoid external dependencies.

## Run

To load and convert png, gif, jpg, bmp files in a directory, add the input directory as first argument
and the output directory optionally as second argument:

```sh
./image_to_jpeg ./dir_with_images ./out
```

The first argument can also be a 

## C-legacy

Throughout this project C-legacy has been avoided as much as possible.
This includes old-style casts, C-Posix API (except the net Socket API) and the C preprocessor (macros).

For example:
* `std::array<uint8_t,8*8>` instead of `uint8_t data[8*8]`
* `std::experimental::source_location` instead of `__LINE__`, `__FILE` etc
* `constexpr` instead of macros and for conditional compilations

C-Libraries like the stb_image library have been properly C++ type wrapped to take advantage of RAII etc.

## C++17 version of the toojpeg library

The original toojpeg only uses C++11 `auto` keyword and is apart from that pretty much C++03.
Its code size, many precomputed lookup tables and numeric values and the IO related domain
makes it a good candidate to experiment with C++17 features.

#### Modern Application Programming Interfaces

Having an API that cannot (un)intentionally being misused while offering an efficient interface is essential.
Ideally the API expresses the developers intention via the C++ type system in regard to input arguments lifetime
and ownership. 

C++17 added the `nodiscard` attribute so that the compilers warn if return values are not used. `noexcept`
allows the compiler to avoid generating stack-unwinding code for functions that will never throw,
which results in better runtime performance if exceptions are enabled:

```c++
[[nodiscard]] const char * data() const noexcept {/*...*/}
```

Smart pointers are used to express ownership:

```c++
explicit BitWriter(std::unique_ptr<std::ostream> &&output_) : output(std::move(output_)) {}
```

While in a non-owning situation, raw pointers and custom (wrapper) types like `ByteView` (a pointer + size) are the correct choice:

```c++
BitWriter &operator<<(ByteView data) { output->write(data.data(), data.size()); return *this; }

bool writeJpeg(..., const uint8_t *pixels, ...) {/*...*/}
```

The new `std::byte` type (C++17) has been used, instead of (unsigned) `char`s.
To quote cppreference:
> "std::byte is a distinct type that implements the concept of byte as specified in the C++ language definition."

To accommodate the fact that `std::byte` cannot simply (implicitly) being created via a integral number,
a (constexpr) user-defined literal (C++14) helps out (usage: `0xff_bn`):

```c++
constexpr std::byte operator "" _bn(unsigned long long v) { return std::byte(v); }
```

And finally new composed data types like `std::optional`, `std::any`, `std::variant` (and the existing `std::tuple`)
and automatic destructuring ("Structured binding declaration") of those (C++17) allow for richer return types:

```c++
constexpr auto scaled_luminance_chrominance(...) -> std::tuple<std::array<...>, std::array<...>> {
    /* ... */
    return std::make_tuple(scaledLuminance, scaledChrominance);
}

/// Structured binding declaration
auto [scaledLuminance, scaledChrominance] = scaled_luminance_chrominance(...);
``` 

#### Compile-time precompute with `constexpr`

It is not unusual to be in the situation of deciding within space vs time tradeoff bounds.
A C++ developer up to C++17 may have favoured runtime computations or "magical constants",
just because it is more convenient than writing an external generator tool and include that
and the results in a buildsystem.

With C++17 `constexpr` got much more expressive (temporary state like inline variables are supported) 
and it will be extended even more with C++20 (const-boundary aware heap usage).

In this project in multiple occasions `constexpr` was used, eg to eliminate "magical numbers":

```c++
// Before
const auto SqrtHalfSqrt = 1.306562965f;
// After
constexpr double SqrtHalfSqrt = sqrt((2 + sqrt(2)) / 2);
```

C++ does not yet offer `constexpr` math (an RFC exists),
but implementing the approximation for the square root for example is done in just a few lines:
```c++
double constexpr sqrt(double x) { return sqrt_helper(x, x, 0); }
double constexpr sqrt_helper(double x, double curr, double prev) {
    return is_close(curr, prev) ? curr : sqrt_helper(x, 0.5 * (curr + x / curr), curr);
}
constexpr auto is_close(T a, T b) -> bool {
    return std::abs(a - b) <= std::numeric_limits<T>::epsilon() * std::abs(a + b)
           || std::abs(a - b) < std::numeric_limits<T>::min();
}
```

Especially useful is `constexpr` to pre-compute lookup tables for example the huffman table
(see `constexpr std::array<BitCode, 256> generateHuffmanTable(const uint8_t numCodes[16], const uint8_t *values)` in `toojpeg_17.hpp`),
and quantisation tables (in ` constexpr auto quant_table(const std::array<uint8_t, 8 * 8> defaults) -> std::array<std::byte, 8 * 8>`).

This allows to use the exact math writen in the original papers (often modulo, division) as we do not need to care about
runtime penalties.

```c++
// Before (faster but not obvious substitutions)
auto row = ZigZagInv[i] >> 3;
auto column = ZigZagInv[i] & 7;
// After
auto row = ZigZagInv[i] / 8;
auto column = ZigZagInv[i] % 8;
```

## Http / TCP Socket

A tiny, blocking http tcp socket type has been implemented for this tool,
based on the Posix socket and network C-API. As with all C-wrapping types,
RAII is build on for resource management (socket closing, resource freeing),
which also works with the error handling strategy (exceptions).

> IMO: As soon as `std::expected` is part of C++ (http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0323r3.pdf),
> I will instantly swap out runtime costly exception usage. See also examples in https://github.com/TartanLlama/expected.
 
Although the type can be conditionally compiled
with and without SSL support (via openSSL), the implementation avoids massive
usage of `#ifdef`s.

Instead C++17's `__has_include` for conditional header including
and type traits in combination with `std::enable_if` (and a bit of SFINAE) have been used.
```c++
/// with ssl
template<bool with_https_ = with_https, typename = std::enable_if_t<with_https_, std::size_t>>
[[nodiscard]] std::size_t read_from_socket(std::enable_if_t<with_https_, std::size_t> dataRead) {
    return cSSL_ ? // Runtime decision if this is an SSL socket
           SSL_read(cSSL_, this->buffer_.data() + dataRead, this->buffer_.size() - dataRead) :
           read(getSocketId(), this->buffer_.data() + dataRead, this->buffer_.size() - dataRead);
}

// without ssl
template<bool with_https_ = with_https, typename = std::enable_if_t<!with_https_, std::size_t>>
[[nodiscard]] std::size_t read_from_socket(std::size_t dataRead) {
    return read(getSocketId(), this->buffer_.data() + dataRead, this->buffer_.size() - dataRead);
}

// Conditionally decide what to do, no #ifdef required anymore
if constexpr (with_https) {
    ...
}
```

## Extended C++ std: Regex, Filesystem, Parallel Algorithms

The filesystem submodule is a massive addition to C++17 and The Standard Library.

This project uses `std::filesystem` for simple operations like retrieving the current path, removing a file, checking
if a file exists, and for more elaborated tasks like enumerating all files, not directories, of a certain directory.  

The c++11 `std::regex` (and implicitly the C++17 `std::basic_regex` deduction guide) has been used for
the webpage image url crawler, found in `main.cpp::webpage_crawler`.

The parallel algorithm support of C++17's std has been used to read, compute and output multiple files in parallel:
```c++
std::for_each(std::execution::par, std::begin(files), std::end(files), [&](Path& path) {
  process_file(path, output_dir);
});
```

## Benchmark

Build the benchmark (found in `src/benchmark/main.cpp) via `cmake` and `make benchmark`.
Run it with `./benchmark` in the build directory. Each routine is run 20 times and the time is summed up.

```
Original TooJpeg : 201 ms. Bytes: 275324
TooJpeg17 : 247 ms. Bytes: 275365
```

Writen byte counts are different because the jpeg comment differs.
(The test suite makes sure that changes to the code result in a failing integration test.)

I have expected a performance gain, by pre-computing the lookup tables.

Using `std::array` comes with its own implications like an implicit full copy-by-value,
in contrast to a pointer for a C-Array. This results in much more copy operations
which can be observed in a runtime penalty. To mitigate this, some std::arrays
could be flat c-array pointers again.

A small benchmark suite, integrated into CI, helps to find negative impacting changes.
I have failed to set that up more early in the process.
